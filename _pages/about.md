I completed my Master’s in Data Science at Seoul National University, where I was advised by Prof. Sang-Kyun Cha and spent most of the time working on the business planning application. I also spent the Summer of 2020 as a data scientist intern at Amorepacific. Before SNU, I did my undergrad at the University of Washington and worked as a research assistant in the healthcare sector under the supervision of Prof. Emisa Nategh.

Broadly, I am interested in building an application for underserved communities, or whose pain-points are less visible and therefore less addressed by tech companies. And I am particularly excited in solving information silo problems in finance, healthcare, communication, and e-commerce. 

I am also constantly working on new projects and looking to get connected. Drop me an email if you want to talk about academics or industry in general.
